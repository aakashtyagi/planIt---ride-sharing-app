	<h3>Do Not Track Disclosure</h3>
	<p class="lead">Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in their web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information we collect and that is why we provide the opt-out links above. However, we do not recognize or respond to any DNT signals, as the Internet industry works toward deﬁning exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.</p>

	<h3>Third Party Websites</h3>
	<p class="lead">There are a number of places on our Service where you may click on a link to access other websites that do no operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement on our Service, you may be taken to a website that we do not control.

	<h3>Your choices about collection and use of your information</h3>

	<h3>How we protect your personal information</h3>
	<p class="lead">We take security measures to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. However, no system can be completely secure.

Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.</p>
